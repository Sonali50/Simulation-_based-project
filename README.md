Ques. 15.  A uniprocessor system has n number of CPU intensive processes, each process has its own requirement of CPU burst. The process with lowest CPU burst is given the highest priority. A late-arriving higher priority process can preempt a currently running process with lower priority. Simulate a scheduler that is scheduling the processes in such a way that higher priority process is never starved due to the execution of lower priority process. What should be its average waiting time and average turnaround time if no two processes are arriving are arriving at same time. 



Ques. 10. Design a scheduler with multilevel queue having two queues which will schedule the processes on the basis of  pre-emptive shortest remaining processing time first algorithm (SROT) followed by a scheduling in which each process will get 2 units of time to execute. Also note that queue 1 has higher priority than queue 2.  Consider the following set of processes (for reference)with their arrival times and the CPU burst times in milliseconds.
-------------------------------------
Process  Arrival-Time   Burst-Time
-------------------------------------
P1             0      	       5
P2             1             	       3
P3             2                       3
P4             4                       1
